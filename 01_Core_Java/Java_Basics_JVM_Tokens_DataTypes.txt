In Java, public class first declares a class named first where public means the class can be accessed from anywhere, which is necessary so that the JVM can find and load the class while running the program. The keyword class is used to create a blueprint or template that contains data and methods, and first is simply the name of that class, which must match the file name (first.java). Inside the class, public static void main(String[] args) is the main method where program execution starts. Here, public allows the JVM to access the method, static means the method can be called without creating an object of the class, void indicates that the method does not return any value, main is the fixed name recognized by the JVM as the entry point of the program, String[] args is a parameter that stores command-line arguments passed to the program, where String represents text data, [] shows it is an array, and args is the variable name used to access those values.

What are Tokens in Java?

teacher ==  the smallest part of java program


Tokens are the smallest meaningful units in a Java program.
The Java compiler breaks a program into tokens to understand and compile the code.

Types of Tokens in Java
1️⃣ Keywords  50
also known as complier aware words
should be in lower case

Reserved words with predefined meaning

Cannot be used as variable names

Examples:
class, public, static, void, int, if, else, return

2️⃣ Identifiers

name given by programmer = identifiers
Names given to classes, variables, methods

Must follow naming rules
we canot use keyword as identifiers
we can not space
we  canot starts with number
special character are not allowed except _ and $


Examples:
first, main, args, sum

3️⃣ Literals
the value or data given by programmer.

Fixed values assigned to variables

types of literals
number:--
Integer → 10

Floating → 3.14

2. Character = it is used to present singal data → 'A' , 'a'

3. String= it use to present group of characters it is inclosed inside double quotes the length could be anything → "Hello"

4. Boolean = it gives us only two values → true, false

4️⃣ Operators

Symbols used to perform operations

Examples:
+ - * / %
= == != > <
&& || !

5️⃣ Separators (Punctuators)

Used to separate program elements or java members

Examples:
() equations, conditions , method declarations
{} block
 ; end of statement
, varaibles
. refernce   india.punjab.phagwara

                          A. Non static == a variable which declare inside class area or global without static keyword
                          B. static variable == a variable which is declare in class are prefix with static keyword


NOTE:--
we can not use local variables without initialization
local variable are not assigned with default value
we can not create two local variable with same names.
local variable can be use only inside same local area.
we can use global variable inside global area as well as local area


WAP in java to calculate area of square whose side is 4.2
Wap TO calculate area of circle whose radius is 5 // rectangle l=3.5 b =4
WAP swap number using tem and without tem ;

## Operators in Java — **Short Notes**

*(Without code • Using symbols • Divided into Unary, Binary, Ternary)*

---


## 1️⃣ Unary Operators (One operand)

* `+`  → Unary plus (positive value)
* `-`  → Unary minus (negative value)
* `++` → Increment by 1 pre and post both
* `--` → Decrement by 1 pre and post both
* `!`  → Logical NOT (true ↔ false)
* `~`  → Bitwise complement

👉 **Use: Operate on **single variable/value**

## 2️⃣ Binary Operators (Two operands)

fixed size.
Primitive data types store simple values and are predefined in Java.

non primitive datatype:--

user defined.
not fixed size.


write a difference between local and global variable

Local variable :--
local variable is the variable which is declare inside main function or local area and can not be access it outside the main function. 
global  variable:--
a variable is declare outside the local area
there are two types global varible:--
 A. static variable:-
  declare inside the local area and static keyword is used in it
B.  non Static == without static keyword




difference between complier and interpreter

Compiler :-- translates whole program first, then runs
if  error occur then it show at compile time at the end .

Interpreter → translates and runs program line by line is error occur it will show at the same time



write a difference between platform dependent and independent language ::--

platform dependent language :--

A language which runs on specific operating system or some platform like c++ c

1. How does the object-oriented nature of Java help in software development?

Java follows the object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, which helps in organizing code in the form of classes and objects.
OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction make the software easier to design,
understand, and maintain. Code reusability reduces development time, and modularity helps teams work on large projects efficiently.

2. Why is Java considered a simple language compared to C and C++?

Java is considered simple because it removes complex features found in C and C++, such as pointers,
manual memory management, multiple inheritance, and operator overloading. Java provides automatic garbage collection,
a clear syntax, and built-in libraries, which makes it easier for developers to write, debug, and maintain programs.

3. How does Java provide security at run time?

Java provides runtime security using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The bytecode verifier checks the code
before execution, and the class loader prevents unauthorized classes from being loaded. Java also uses
Security Manager and access control mechanisms to restrict illegal operations, making Java programs safe from viruses and malicious code.

4. What makes Java a robust language?

Java is considered robust because it has strong memory management, automatic garbage collection,
and exception handling. It avoids common programming errors like memory leaks and crashes. Compile-time and runtime error
checking also help in creating reliable and stable applications.

5. How does Java achieve high performance?

Java achieves high performance through the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which converts frequently
used bytecode into native machine code at runtime. This improves execution speed. Efficient memory management
and optimized JVM architecture also contribute to better performance.

6. What do you mean by portability in Java?

Portability in Java means “Write Once, Run Anywhere.” Java programs are compiled into bytecode,
which can run on any system that has a JVM, regardless of the operating system or hardware. This makes Java applications platform-independent.

7. Why does Java have strong industries and job opportunities?

Java is widely used in enterprise applications, web development, mobile applications (Android),
banking systems, cloud computing, and big data. Many large companies rely on Java for building secure and scalable applications.
Due to its wide usage and long-term stability, Java offers strong job opportunities across industries.
