🔹 Java Platform Components (Very Important)
1️⃣ JDK (Java Development Kit)

Used to develop and run Java programs
Contains:
JRE
Compiler (javac)
Debugger
Other development tools

✅ Use: Writing, compiling, and running Java code

2️⃣ JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

Used to run Java programs
Contains:
JVM
Core Java libraries

❌ Does NOT contain compiler
✅ Use: Running Java applications

3️⃣ JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

Executes Java bytecode (.class file)
Makes Java platform-independent
Handles:
Memory management
Garbage collection
Security

📌 JVM is platform-dependent, but Java is platform-independent

4️⃣ JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler)

Part of JVM
Converts bytecode into native machine code
Improves performance and speed

🔹 Java Program Structure
public class First {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}

Explanation (in paragraph):

In Java, public class First declares a class named First. The keyword public allows the class to be accessed from anywhere, which is required so that the JVM can load the class during execution. The keyword class is used to define a blueprint or template that contains variables and methods, and First is the class name which must match the file name (First.java). Inside the class, public static void main(String[] args) is the main method where program execution begins. The keyword public allows JVM access, static means the method can run without creating an object, void indicates no return value, main is the fixed entry point recognized by JVM, and String[] args stores command-line arguments passed to the program.

🔹 Tokens in Java
What are Tokens?

Tokens are the smallest meaningful units of a Java program.
The Java compiler breaks code into tokens to understand and compile it.

Types of Tokens in Java
1️⃣ Keywords

Predefined, compiler-aware words
Always written in lowercase
Cannot be used as variable names

Examples:
class, public, static, void, int, if, else, return

2️⃣ Identifiers

Names given by the programmer
Used for classes, variables, and methods

Rules:
Cannot be a keyword
Cannot start with a number
No spaces allowed
Special characters not allowed except _ and $

Examples:
First, main, args, sum

3️⃣ Literals
Fixed values provided by the programmer

Types:
Integer → 10
Floating → 3.14
Character → 'A'
String → "Hello"
Boolean → true, false

4️⃣ Operators
Symbols used to perform operations

Examples:
+ - * / %
= == != > <
&& || !

5️⃣ Separators (Punctuators)
Used to separate Java program elements

Examples:
() → conditions, methods
{} → blocks
; → end of statement
, → multiple variables
. → reference (e.g., india.punjab.phagwara)

🔹 Data Types in Java
What is Data Type?
A data type specifies what kind of data a variable can store.

1️⃣ Primitive Data Types
Built-in
Fixed size
Store simple values
Faster execution

Data Type	Size	Description	Example
byte	1 byte	Small integers	byte b = 10;
short	2 bytes	Short integers	short s = 100;
int	4 bytes	Whole numbers	int a = 20;
long	8 bytes	Large integers	long l = 1000L;
float	4 bytes	Decimal values	float f = 2.5f;
double	8 bytes	Large decimals	double d = 10.25;
char	2 bytes	Single character	char c = 'A';
boolean	1 bit	true/false	boolean x = true;

2️⃣ Non-Primitive Data Types
Store reference/address
Size is not fixed
User-defined

Type	Description	Example
String	Text data	String name = "Java";
Array	Multiple values	int[] arr = {1,2,3};
Class	Blueprint	class Student {}
Interface	Contract	interface A {}
🔹 Variables in Java
A. Based on Data Type
1️⃣ Primitive Variables
Store simple values
Fixed size
Faster
Examples:
int, float, char, boolean

2️⃣ Non-Primitive Variables

Store reference of objects
Can store multiple values
Size not fixed
Examples:
String, Array, Object

B. Based on Scope
1️⃣ Local Variable

Declared inside a method or block
No default value
Must be initialized before use

2️⃣ Global Variable (Class Level)

Declared inside class but outside methods
Types:
Non-static variable (instance variable)
Static variable (declared using static keyword)

📝 Important Notes

Local variables have no default value
Local variables must be initialized
Duplicate local variable names not allowed

Local variables work only inside their block

Global variables can be accessed inside methods
